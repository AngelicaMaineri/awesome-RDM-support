# Awesome RDM support
*What*: A curated list of organisations and groups that offer RDM support and expertise.

*What is an [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list?*

This list collects sources of RDM support and expertise at different levels. If you have questions or remarks, reach out to [Angelica Maineri](mailto:angelica@odissei-data.nl). The list started as a recommendation in a paper which is currently under review. If you want to add resources to the list, please consult the file `CONTRIBUTION_GUIDELINES.md`.

The list is organised by level (institution, national, international) and disciplinary focus (discipline-specific vs. general purpose). When applicable, the country is indicated using [ISO-3166-alpha3 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes)
